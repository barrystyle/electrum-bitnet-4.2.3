it is not possible to export from 4.2.2 and import into 4.1.5
it is also not possible to export from 4.1.5 and import into 4.2.2
export from 4.2.2 will only work with bitnet-qt import as long as the bitnet-qt wallet is changed to a legacy wallet instead of an HD wallet

THE SUGGESTION IS TO KEEP YOUR PRIVATE KEY OR YOUR SEEd PHRASE DOCUMENTED FOR THE VERSION OF THE WALLET WHEN YOU MAKE IT

BACKUP YOUR SEED PHRASE WITH EITHER A SCREEN SHOT AND ALSO LABEL THE SCREENSHOT WITH THE VERSION EITHER 4.2.2 or 4.1.5 DEPENDING ON THE WALLET IT WAS MADe WITH TO
SAFEGUARD YOUR KEYS


## WHAT IS WORKING WHAT IS NOT WORKING BETWEEN DIFFERENT VERSIONS

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO EXPORT SEED PHRASE FROM 4.2.2 DESKTOP and IMPORT INTO 4.2.2 android

when sending a transaction using the camera IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO SCAN A QR CODE USING THE ANDROID 4.2.2 VERSION FROM A DESKTOP VERSION 4.2.2 (but 4.2.2 android will scan 4.1.5 receving address segwit QR codes fine)

so that two wallets are linked:: IT IS POSSIBLE TO EXPORT A WALLET ADDRESS PRIVATE KEY FROM 4.2.2 android and import the private key receving address into 4.2.2 desktop (4.2.2 android and 4.1.5 android do not support import of private keys only export of private keys)
