it is not possible to export from 4.2.2 and import into 4.1.5
it is also not possible to export from 4.1.5 and import into 4.2.2
export from 4.2.2 will only work with bitnet-qt import as long as the bitnet-qt wallet is changed to a legacy wallet instead of an HD wallet

THE SUGGESTION IS TO KEEP YOUR PRIVATE KEY OR YOUR SEEd PHRASE DOCUMENTED FOR THE VERSION OF THE WALLET WHEN YOU MAKE IT

BACKUP YOUR SEED PHRASE WITH EITHER A SCREEN SHOT AND ALSO LABEL THE SCREENSHOT WITH THE VERSION EITHER 4.2.2 or 4.1.5 DEPENDING ON THE WALLET IT WAS MADe WITH TO
SAFEGUARD YOUR KEYS
